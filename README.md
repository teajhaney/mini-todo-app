# Mini Todo App
A simple, responsive todo list application built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This app allows users to manage tasks with features like adding, editing, deleting, and toggling completion status, all while persisting data in localStorage. Todos are categorized by day for better organization.

# Features
**Add Todos:** Create new tasks with a timestamp and day label.
**Edit Todos:** Modify existing tasks (disabled for completed todos).
**Delete Todos:** Remove tasks with a trash icon.
**Toggle Completion:** Check/uncheck todos with a custom checkbox (white check mark on green background).
**Day Categorization:** Group todos by day (e.g., "March 23, 2025") with bold labels.
**Persistent Storage:** Todos are saved to localStorage and persist across page reloads.
**Responsive Design:** Works on small screens with text wrapping and no horizontal scrolling.
**Animations:** Smooth transitions for adding and removing todos using framer-motion.
